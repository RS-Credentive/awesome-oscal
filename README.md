A collection of awesome community resources, [maybe not quite production ready](https://gitter.im/usnistgov-OSCAL/Lobby?at=6075cc8f2e5574669b34555d), for increasing the adoption of the [Open Security Controls Assessment Language, OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL).

## Tools

- [Brian Ruf's OSCAL-GUI](https://github.com/brian-ruf/OSCAL-GUI): An example PHP web interface developed by [@brian-ruf](https://github.com/brian-ruf) of former FedRAMP fame. It has core presentation logic, file import, format conversion, and working profile resolution.

- [GSA's OSCAL Tools](https://github.com/GSA?q=oscal-&type=&language=&sort=): A collection of open-source tools provided by GSA teams to interoperate between OSCAL data (with required FedRAMP Extensions) and Word (DOCX) formats for SSPs, SARs, and SAPs.

- [GoComply's FedRAMP Utility](https://github.com/GoComply/fedramp): a tool that uses oscalkit (see below) to stamp in OSCAL data to the FedRAMP Word (DOCX) system security plan templates.

- [GoComply's oscalkit](https://github.com/GoComply/oscalkit): a Golang-based software development kit and command-line utility for operating on OSCAL data models. 

- [GovReady's GovReady-Q](github.com/GovReady/govready-q): An open source, web-based self-service GRC tool to automate security assessments and compliance from [@gregelin](https://github.com/gregelin) and the GovReady crew. It focuses on import and export of OSCAL data models.

- [IBM Compliance Trestle](https://github.com/IBM/compliance-trestle): An opinionated command-line tooling platform for managing compliance as code, using continuous integration and NIST's OSCAL standard.

- [John Jediny's OSCAL Static Site Playground](https://github.com/JJediny/oscal-static-site-playground): a static web application, using Gatsby and the US Web Design System, with hosting on the Federalist platform, to host a modern responsive application with OSCAL data models in JSON format dropped in place.

- [mocolicious OSCAL-Examples](https://github.com/mocolicious/OSCAL-Examples): A collection of different front-end web applications leveraging OSCAL, mainly to show off different development workflows and environments. Current development status or community use is unclear.

- [SHR Group's pyOSCAL](https://gitlab.com/shrgroup/oss/python/pyoscal): Python library to convert OSCAL content into python objects, developed by the clever [@mruge](https://github.com/mruge).  [pyOSCAL-Builder](https://gitlab.com/shrgroup/oss/python/pyoscal-builder) automatically generates pyOSCAL dynamically from the lastes NIST OSCAL Metaschema.

- [Wendell Piez's OSCAL Profile Import Examiner](https://wendellpiez.github.io/XMLjellysandwich/oscal/import-examiner/): [XMLJellySandwich]((https://github.com/wendellpiez/XMLjellysandwich)) is a web-based, in-browser XSLT transform system leveraging SaxonJS. [@wendellpiez](https://github.com/wendellpiez) has focused one demo on validating an OSCAL profile in XML form by validating upstream catalog references.
