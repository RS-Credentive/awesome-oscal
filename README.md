A collection of awesome community resources, [maybe not quite production ready](https://gitter.im/usnistgov-OSCAL/Lobby?at=6075cc8f2e5574669b34555d), for increasing the adoption of the [Open Security Controls Assessment Language, OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL).

## Tools

- [GovReadyQ](github.com/GovReady/govready-q): An open source, web-based self-service GRC tool to automate security assessments and compliance from [@gregelin](https://github.com/gregelin) and the GovReady crew. It focuses on import and export of OSCAL data models.

- [IBM Compliance Trestle](https://github.com/IBM/compliance-trestle): An opinionated command-line tooling platform for managing compliance as code, using continuous integration and NIST's OSCAL standard. 

- [pyOSCAL-Builder](https://gitlab.com/shrgroup/oss/python/pyoscal-builder): Python scripts and tools to create a Python library to process OSCAL data, developed by the clever [@mruge](https://github.com/mruge). Built on a library to generate [Python classes](https://gitlab.com/shrgroup/oss/python/pyoscal) from Metaschema.
